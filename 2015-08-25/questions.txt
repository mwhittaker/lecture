## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

Assume that the time in seconds to start the process (i.e. explain the process
to the students) takes a fixed number of seconds `t_s`. Assume there are `n`
rows `r_1, r_2, ..., r_n` such that it takes `t_ri` seconds for row `r_i` to
count its students. Assume it takes `t_c` seconds for the instructor to gather
a single row count and `t_a` seconds for the instructor to perform arithmetic
on a single count.

Then, the amount of time required to count a class of `n` rows is

    t_s + max({t_ri | i in [1, n]}) + n * (t_c + t_a) [Eq. 1]

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

When a single person counts students one by one, there is no overhead in
explaining the process or performing arithmetic. If it takes `t` seconds to
count a single student, then it requires `k * t` [Eq. 2] seconds to count `k`
students.

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

Formally, it would be the smallest number of students such that the time
computed by Eq 1. is smaller than the time computed by Eq 2. Practically, it
would probably be around 100 or so students.
